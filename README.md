# SDE-Sheet Solutions
This is the day to day implementation of the [SDE-Sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SM92efk8oDl8nyVw8NHPnbGexTS9W-1gmTEYfEurLWQ/edit).

This also has some random algorithms!

**Note:** Don't run the folder_maker.ps1 file unless you completely know what it does (it creates folders). If the loop inside is made into an infinite loop it is ensentially a virus that can fill the drive it was run on ;)

Thanks to Striver from [takeUforward](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJskGeByzRRSvmOyZOz61ig) for making the SDE sheet and explaining the problems in it.
